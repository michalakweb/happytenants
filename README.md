# Happy Tenants
> Keep track of the things that need to be done in your apartment

Happy Tenants is an information tracker has two features:
- adding items to a todo list
- viewing the current chores for the week.

Currently it's in beta phase and serves more as a showcase of technologies used in it. It's a React app that uses ReactRouter for routing, Redux for managing state and Firebase to serve data among different users.  It's also a Progressive Web App - you can add it to your Andoid/iOS homescreen and check it out for yourself!
