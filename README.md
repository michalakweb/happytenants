# Happy Tenants
> Keep track of the things that need to be done in your apartment

Happy Tenants is an information tracker that has two features:
- adding items to a todo list
- viewing the current chores for the week.

Working example: [https://michalakweb.github.io/happytenants/](https://michalakweb.github.io/happytenants/)

It's in beta phase and serves more as a showcase of technologies used in it. It's a React app that uses ReactRouter for routing, Redux for managing state and Firebase to serve data among different users.  It's also a Progressive Web App - you can add it to your Andoid homescreen! 

Currently, all users are allowed to make changes into the firebase and the chores for the week are set programatically. That will change in the future releases.
